           <p>There I was, an empty piece of a shell
Just minding my own world
Without even knowing what love and life were all about
Then you came
You brought me out of the shell
You gave the world to me
And before I knew
There I was, so in love with you
You gave me a reason for my being
And I love what I'm feeling
You gave me a meaning to my life
Yes, I've gone beyond existing
And it all began when I met you
I love the touch of your hair
And when I look in your eyes
I just know, I know I'm onto something good
And I'm sure, my love for you will endure
Your love will light up my world
And take all my cares away where they can't bother me
You gave me a reason for my being
And I love what I'm feeling
You gave me a meaning to my life
Yes, I've gone beyond existing
And it all began when I met you
You taught me how to love
You showed me a tomorrow and today
My love, that's different from the yesterday I knew
You taught me how to love
And darling, I will always cherish you
Today, tomorrow, and forever
And I'm sure when evening comes around
I know, we'll be making love like never before
My love, who could ask for more?
You gave me a reason for my being
And I love what I'm feeling
You gave me a meaning to my life
Yes, I've gone beyond existing
And it all began when I met you
When I met you
You gave me a reason (for my being)
And I love what I'm feeling (love what I'm feeling)
